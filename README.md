# APPLICATIONS QUICK STARTUP TOOL
## VER 1.2.0

### application-startup-tool.cmd

## Main purpose:

In the case of an overnight reboot of my system, this tool launches some main applications that I use, so they are open, loaded and ready to use.  
This way, I don't forget to open something until I'm in the middle of a helpdesk call and then the customer and I both have to wait until the program that I am needing finally opens and loads.

Opens:
Outlook
Edge; to restore session
OneNote; normally takes forever to open
Chrome; opens to chosen site as admin for remote assistance
XXXXXX
XXXXXX

Then checks to see that they opened and displays processes with process IDs.

#### NOTE: Chrome must be set to RUN AS ADMIN; 
To set: Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application and right-click chrome.exe > properties > Compatibility tab > tick 'Run this program as an administrator' option > click OK
